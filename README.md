Software developer with over 2 years of experience in engineering robust, scalable and maintainable software solutions.
<br><br>
At MathWorks, I am a part of the Subsystem Reference team, where I contribute to advancing the product capabilities that streamline model development and support MathWorks mission of accelerating the pace of engineering and science.
<br><br>
My inclination toward software took root during school years, driven via fascination with how websites take shape on the backend, how different files come together to present an elegant UI, and how lines of code can turn ideas into tangible outcomes. This inclination gained momentum in college, where I explored core computer science concepts and strengthened problem-solving skills, the foundation of functional software. Motivated to get hands-on, I began building personal projects, starting with a portfolio site and progressing to more complex systems, observing scripts grow into powerful tools. This experience ignited a profound commitment to problem-solving and pioneering ideas.
<br><br>
I have hands-on experience developing software across full SDLC in Agile environments, with a strong emphasis on writing clean, modular and testable code. Driven by tackling complex engineering challenges through comprehensive research followed with translating customer needs into workable requirements and delivering modern effective solutions.
<br><br>
I embrace the mindset of lifelong learning, recognizing that life is the ultimate teacher. Each experience carries a lesson and I seek to absorb these lessons, turn them into understanding and foster a meaningful awareness of life.
