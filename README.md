Software development engineer with over 2 years of experience in delivering robust, scalable and maintainable software solutions.
<br><br>
At MathWorks, I am a part of the Subsystem Reference team, where I work on advancing the product capabilities that streamline model development and support MathWorks mission of accelerating the pace of engineering and science.
<br><br>
My inclination toward software took root during school years, driven via fascination with how lines of code can turn ideas into tangible outcomes. This inclination gained momentum in college, where I explored core computer science concepts and strengthened the foundation of functional software. Motivated to get hands-on, I began building personal projects, starting with a portfolio site and progressing to more complex systems, observing scripts grow into powerful tools.
<br><br>
I have hands-on experience developing software across full software development lifecycle in Agile environments, with a strong emphasis on writing clean, modular and testable code. Driven by tackling complex engineering challenges through careful research followed with translating customer needs into workable requirements and delivering modern effective solutions.
<br><br>
I embrace the mindset of lifelong learning, recognizing that life is the ultimate teacher. Each experience carries a lesson and I seek to absorb these lessons, turn them into understanding and foster a meaningful awareness of life.
